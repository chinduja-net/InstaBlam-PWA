### 1. Assignment description
You will build a PWA that combines the techniques we have gone through in the course.

The app will be published online with https://surge.sh/ which we used in the course. It should use React.


#### Compatibility
Because PWA is a relatively new technology, with incomplete support in different browsers and on different platforms; it is difficult to achieve 100% support for all features. The submissions will be tested on a Windows computer with Chrome and Firefox. If you are unsure whether your app will work, you can report the swaying bits in lesson time to the teacher.


#### Appen: Instablam
* These are the requirements that your app must meet. *

Instablam should be a PWA, which the user can use to take pictures with their mobile, or computer with camera. When you take a picture, it should be saved in a gallery in the app. Along with the photo, you should save information about when it was taken, and at what location. If the user does not allow location information, it must be clear in the image that the app does not know where it was taken.

The user should be able to browse the gallery, delete individual images, download an image. There must be at least two images in the gallery when the app starts.

** VG **: Try using reverse geocoding to show the nearest location, instead of latitude and longitude.

** VG **: Function for the app to wait 3 seconds and then take a picture. When the picture is taken, a notification should be displayed.

** VG **: The app's files and captured images are cached, so the user can view them even in offline mode.


#### Test your app
Use more than one browser when testing your app. Feel free to collaborate with classmates so that you can test your apps in as many different environments as possible.

Remember that you can also test the app with the Lighthouse setting Progressive Web App.

### 2. Submission
Your project should be a GitHub repo. Write the link to both the GitHub repot and the published app as a comment on the submission.
Tell us briefly about your app and the most important features. Zip the entire repot (except `node_modules /` and `.git /`) and upload to LearnPoint.

** Tip! ** You should use the zip format to compress the files. The easiest way is to download a zip archive from GitHub.
